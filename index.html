	<p>Not quite convinced about the idea of counting the positives after a lost match, India's new Test captain Virat Kohli said the days of learning are long over and his team would be solely focussed on delivering results. (Kohli says he won't change his leadership style)</p>
	<p>Addressing a pre-departrure press conference here today ahead of the tour of Bangladesh, which starts with a one-off Test from June 10, Kohli said his focus is on results. (Team India's success lies in perfect combination of fitness and skill levels: Virat Kohli)</p>
	<p> He said,<span class="blockquote">
	"We have learnt a lot, I don't think we need to play with a mindset of playing to learn. Obviously, we learn about the game all the time, even when we are watching it on TV"
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>But we have played long enough now, we know what we want to achieve as a unit. So, we really want to achieve rather than go out of a match thinking what we have learnt from it," Kohli said when asked about his expectations from the team.</p>
	<p>Insisting that the team is in good shape for the Bangladesh tour, which will also have three ODIs, Kohli said fitness is a prime concern to ensure that his side keeps a steady look. (Rahul Dravid says he was always interested in grooming youngsters)</p>
